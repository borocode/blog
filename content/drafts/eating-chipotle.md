eating chipotle well really only eating the chips and queso; my bowl is getting cold writing this im realizing i don't have a good enough vocabulary to write non-tweets let alone long form blog posts and have not absorbed enough non-fiction, academia or not, to relay any sort of useful actionable information 

if you're here for "alpha" or trading or lol, "career" advice, there is none! you can exit at any time   my bowl is getting cold and i would rather submit this entry into the void than eat  

weird 

anyways food getting cold writing reminds me that winter is coming and im dreading it like i always do 

im dreading inevitable halloween content and thanksgiving content and christmas content and then anxiety of  new year eve just a  cute Reminder‚Ñ¢Ô∏è how i spent the last ùë¶ years stuck in my head  

stronger as a result? lol no. fully unemployable with no marketable skills! lol yep

then comes vday to finish up winter the content is soul crushing but im not gonna be pressed others are in love i am gonna be pressed about another year of the self driving self improvement with no end in sight idk comparison thief of joy something whatever

my queso is done and my unopened coke  was fridge cold when I started this post room temperature now will probably commit and push this post then open up the bowl did two sets of five squats around 8pm will do another set after i take a few bites its 1036pm
