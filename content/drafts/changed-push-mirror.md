woah i didn't know i could lower the push mirror MIN_INTERVAL (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/8252#issuecomment-534138330) to 1m thought the min was 25m just had to add it to the config (https://community.getumbrel.com/t/gitea-app-ini-location/9699/2) now i needa pick up a cheapo wi-fi plug  `UPS > wifi plug > umbrel` ideally nothing ever shuts down but the raspi typically fucks up more than the UPS if I can restart my raspi remotely when it does fuck up that'd be great lol not like i leave the house not sure why i am **battle testing** this "software stack" its basically fantasy, sci-fi per se, like *whiny voice crying knocking everything over bumping into every sharp corner and object* everyone else is a digital nomad or whatever i'm just trying to fit in.. i guess.. idk its a mental thing and i am looser
