okay. 

Now I've got a fully functional setup using code-server. This is cool. Can actually avoid ssh'ing into my main system for now. Seems like I can run everything (Hugo, Gitea, code-server, Tailscale) off this rpi for now. 

It's a little bit crowded and I'm not entirely sure how I will handle backups seeing as it is my Umbrel device. I guess there is a benefit to having no coins.
