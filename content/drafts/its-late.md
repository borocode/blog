slept all day woke up when first trick or treater rang door bell and walked away when none of us answered. just finished tea. gonna make some shrimp and rice but super plain not like shrimp fried rice just shrimp and white rice no veg egg accoutrements or garnish et ceteras. i can feel my mental health deteriorating in real time. will probably delete this post in a day or next time I feel like im messing up my only opportunities left in life by portraying myself online as a negative and jaded individual (I guess I am that but makes for bad lasting impressions) or whatever. hope fully i dont fumble this shrimp or rice there are 9.5 shrimps 1 cup of rice should do. sorry this isn't a recipe blog post
