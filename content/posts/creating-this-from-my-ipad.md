Alright, so I got the stack. It is a little bit clunky but wow does it feel like I've accomplished something. I am typing all this from my ARTECK iPad mini (2021) keyboard case using the app Termius to ssh into my W11 machine (yes, my home rig, the main one) using a public/private key pairs instead of just logging in via my username and password. I can run my W11 Hugo install to creat a post and then use nano from my wsl2 Ubuntu install to complete the posts created by my W11 Hugo. Safe to say, these posts will not have much spell or punctuation checks. kekw

Ok. Coming to the end of this post and I'm realizing I have no elegant way to push this like I do via vscode. Going to try git in command prompt. Wish me luck. 

edit- fail. test 

edit2- lfg, kind of an unelegant solution but got something up and running. Not sure if I would use this stack in an enterprise solution but I don't think I can make any better of the compromises wrt mobility and security. Pretty happy. Technically, I should be able to post from any where in the world without relying on a service to stay online. This is a pretty good setup for text posts but would love to come up with a solution for other media too.
