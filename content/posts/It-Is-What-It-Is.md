What do you do when you can't? The problem with people today is that they don't stand for anything. You can't even associate with people like this because the goal posts move in one breath. People don't want to acknowledge any of their faults and want to find someone or someones to offload the pain on to. It's strange because it only takes a tiny bit of Self-Awareness to avoid this type of behavior.
