I have been trading crypto currencies spot and derivatives/futures/CFDs since 2017 and I've learned quite a lot. This post won't be about that but more about the relationship people have with money. 

I would give credit to this run from the 2023 memecoin run on Ethereum and while there are a few tokens that survived since that period, most have had major drawdowns, community takeovers and outright rugs. 

The liquidity was flush at first but participants that can't afford to transact on mainnet missed out. FOMO late comers traded chop and lost on gas fees. Fall time, naturally, interest in Solana picks up, Jupiter Airdrop happens end of January and by March we were in a full on froth. 

People could launch memecoins with no technical experience or even underlying liquidity.

This leads me to my main point. In this industry, you feel as if there are actually people you can align with. It's a breath of fresh air. Then you have a conversation with anon. 

Anon bought coin for $100. He is complaining in a chat with thousands of user. The token went down in value. He says it's $14 now. I tell him to hold. He doesn't hold. He sells his tokens for $14 to buy dinner. 

Why did he buy the token? Wouldn't he have been better off buying nothing at all? Why did he sell? The token is barely a week old. Let's say buying a coin is a job, sure whatever, what job pays you before your work week is over? 

This leads me to believe people don't actually care about their money. If people don't care about their money, it is probably easy to game them out of it. He was willing to spend $100, spend his time watching it go down and then complain in the chat about it. It's sad sure but funny because he doesn't see the irony. 

Are there no goods or services worth $100? I bought shampoo, conditioner and Uber Eats today and spent $100. Wouldn't he have been better off buying shampoo, conditioner, getting a $14 dinner and having extra cash left over? 

I'm not fudding the industry per se, it's just interesting to see the disconnect. Feels like what we've built here is like a decentralized lottery system instead of decentralizing finance. Ideally our lottery winners buy Bitcoin but it's nearly impossible to convince winners to do things they don't want to do with their winnings.
