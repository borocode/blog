I’m trying to write this post right here in the notes app on iPad. 

So my idea is that anytime, anywhere in the world, I can write whatever I want to write (within current chosen framework limitations), turn Tailscale on if I don’t already have it on, SSH into my W11 machine (can always use a bezos machine in the future but will stick to self-hosting for now), use the Hugo executable to create a new post page, copypasta from the notes app to that page, switch true to false on the ‘draft’ key pair, save the file and git magic changes/commits to the Gitea on my raspi. 

Currently don’t want to publish this blog as it is basically spam, but I feel like maybe eventually will come up with something cool or useful or helpful. I’m going to try to have this as something to look forward to but maybe I can use it to get more things done in my life in general. 

I don’t know.
