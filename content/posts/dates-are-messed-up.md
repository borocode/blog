Not sure why but the created and updated dates are not working correctly. Will troubleshoot some other time. 

edit- just kidding. Got it working. Blog is live at borocode.github.io (or it should be).......


edit2- ok still not working. gitinfo failing the last modified dates. not sure what to do. I'm pushing the repo from gitea to github so there may be an issue there but idk.
