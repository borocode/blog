Not sure why but the created and updated dates are not working correctly. Will troubleshoot some other time. 

edit- just kidding. Got it working. Blog is live at borocode.github.io (or it should be).......


edit2- ok still not working. gitinfo failing the last modified dates. not sure what to do. I'm pushing the repo from gitea to github so there may be an issue there but idk.


edit3- The last modified + gitinfo params is fucking up after github pages does its thing. It is working perfectly locally. Oh well.

edit4- my solution is just to remove the dates. You can track the github if you want to see when changes were committed. Gitea will push mirror every 25 mins. the Tweet that I sent that got @BoroGhor banned permanently was "@Socal_crypto God Forbid A muslim Says This Over And Over Again Yet We Have Faggots Like You "Serving And Protecting" KYS Lame", for posterity.
