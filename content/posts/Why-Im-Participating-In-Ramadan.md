Ramadan is a special month for Muslims around the world. It is a time when they abstain from food, drink and sexual relations from dawn to sunset, as an act of worship and obedience to Allah. But what if you haven't fasted Ramadan for a long time? What if you have missed many years of this blessed month due to laziness, ignorance or other excuses? Is it too late to start fasting again? What are the benefits of fasting Ramadan after a long gap?

The answer is: it's never too late to return to Allah and His commands. Allah is the Most Merciful and Forgiving, and He loves those who repent and seek His forgiveness. Fasting Ramadan after a long time can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding and transformative. Here are some reasons why you should fast Ramadan even if you haven't done it in a long time:

1) Fasting Ramadan brings you closer to Allah. The main purpose of fasting is to attain taqwa (God-consciousness), which means being aware of Allah's presence and His rights over us at all times. Fasting helps us remember Allah more often, thank Him for His blessings, seek His guidance and protection, and avoid His displeasure and punishment. Fasting also makes us more humble and sincere in our worship, as we realize our dependence on Allah for everything.

2) Fasting Ramadan purifies your soul and body. Fasting cleanses your soul from sins and bad habits, as you restrain yourself from lawful desires for the sake of Allah. Fasting also detoxifies your body from harmful substances and improves your health and immunity. Fasting gives your digestive system a break and allows it to heal and rejuvenate.

3) Fasting Ramadan teaches you self-discipline and self-control. Fasting trains you to control your impulses and emotions, such as anger, greed, lust, envy, etc. Fasting helps you develop patience and perseverance in facing hardships and challenges. Fasting also teaches you moderation and balance in your lifestyle, as you learn to appreciate what you have and avoid wastefulness.

4) Fasting Ramadan increases your compassion and generosity. Fasting makes you empathize with those who are less fortunate than you, who suffer from hunger, thirst, poverty or oppression. Fasting motivates you to share your wealth and resources with them, especially through zakat (obligatory charity) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Fasting also strengthens your bonds with your family and community, as you break your fast together
and pray together.

5) Fasting Ramadan enhances your spiritual growth
and development.
Fasting opens up new horizons for
you
to explore
your faith
and deepen
your understanding
of Islam.
Fasting encourages
you
to read
the Quran,
the word of Allah,
which was revealed in this month,
and reflect on its meanings
and messages.
Fasting also invites
you
to increase
your supplications,
remembrance,
and gratitude
to Allah,
especially during
the last ten nights,
which contain Laylatul Qadr (the Night of Power),
the most blessed night of the year.

These are some of the reasons why fasting Ramadan is beneficial for us,
even if we haven't done it in a long time.
Of course,
there are many more benefits that we can discover by ourselves,
as we experience this unique month.
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

"Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith 
and seeking reward from Allah,
his past sins will be forgiven."
(Bukhari)

So let us not miss this opportunity 
to return to Allah 
and renew our commitment 
to His religion.
Let us not let our past mistakes 
or our present challenges 
stop us from fasting Ramadan 
with sincerity 
and enthusiasm.
Let us make this Ramadan 
the best one ever!
