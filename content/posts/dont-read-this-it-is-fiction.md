i thought we were telepathic cryptic edaters but she posted a lana del ray "other woman" tik tok and there is no "other woman" uh whoops so shes gotta be upset about some other guy lol to save myself from the epic fail and sheer embarrassment (I've confessed my **love** simpishly multiple times) i blocked her on everything i will now try to erase the years of obsession from my brain eternal sunshine style then ill be able to Fall in Love, again, but this time *normally* (?) and be regular and happy like everyone else (like you, the reader, normal and regular and happy)  

anyways, sorry, how I'm doing? just wrapping up a year long freak out so if you see me pouting i'm not pouting I Am Fine Thanks For Asking üòê
