Hugo set up on my Windows machine makes it so I can commit these posts fairly easily while at my machine but I'm trying to figure out a mobile stack. Currently have gitea running on my Umbrel Raspberry Pi which I can reach outside of my home network using Tailscale but I don't want to install Hugo on the Umbrel board. Technically, this would be enough for a mobile stack if iPad could run Linux natively but since I can't, I have to be more creative. I don't want to have to SSH into my Windows machine either. I don't want to install Hugo on my Umbrel and don't want to SSH into my Windows machine, which leaves me with very little. I could write these .md files by hand but I'm pretty sure theres gotta be a better way to do this. edit- want to see if the date update works when I make a change to a post.
